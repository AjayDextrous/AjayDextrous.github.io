Hi, I'm Ajay Narayanan! I am a student at the Technical University of Munich studying Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence. I have a passion for using technology to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives.

In addition to my studies, I have extensive experience as an Android Developer, with a focus on creating seamless and intuitive user experiences. My technical interests include Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning, and I am always seeking new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas.  I am also interested in entrepreneurship and startups, and am always looking for like minded people :)

Outside of my technical pursuits, I am an active and well-rounded individual with a variety of interests. I enjoy performing improv comedy, playing basketball, listening to podcasts, and hiking, to name just a few. These activities allow me to stay engaged and have fun, and I believe that having a strong balance between work and play is essential for a fulfilling life.

If you're looking for someone with a strong technical background and a passion for problem-solving, I would love the opportunity to connect. Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope to hear from you soon!
