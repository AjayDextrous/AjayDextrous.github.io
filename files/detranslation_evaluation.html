<p> 
Dorothy lived in a large plain with her uncle the farmer and her aunt the farmer's wife. Their house was small because they transported wood with a large cart over a long distance. Walls, floors, and roofs made a room; the room contained a rusty stove and a cabinet and a table and chairs or beds. The uncle and aunt had a large bed in the corner and Dorothy had a small bed in the corner. The attic and the basement were not used but a small opening was dug in the soil to call the basement because the family arrived and a large tornado rose and a large building. They arrived through the central floor opening and the ladder carried a small dark opening.
</p>
<p> 
Dorothy stands at the door and looks, she does not see the large gray plain beyond the boundary. Neither the tree nor the house destroys the wide flat area reaching the boundary of the sky beyond the direction. The sun burned and turned over the gray soil with a small amount of narrow openings stretching beyond. The grass is green because the sun burned the top long leaf and it is a gray color seen beyond. The house was painted but the sun blistered the paint and the rain washed beyond and the house is dark gray and a collection.
</p>
<p> 
Aunt Em lived in the center with a limited and delicate married woman. The sun and the wind changed her. She removed the brightness from her eyes and left her dignified and grey. She removed the redness from her cheeks and lips and they became grey. She was thin and solemn and did not smile. Dorothy arrived as a child, and Aunt Em was startled by the child's laughter and cried and pressed her hands to her heart and Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears. And she attentively watched the young girl and was surprised as she embraced the laughter.
</p>
<p> 
Uncle Henry does not laugh. He works hard morning and night and did not know happiness. He is gray and has a long beard and worn shoes and he looks stern and serious and rarely speaks.
</p>
<p> 
Toto is and causes Dorothy to laugh and saves the central grey. Toto is not grey; it is a very small black long shiny very small black flickering joyously its nose funny small. Toto plays day long and Dorothy plays it and it loves affectionately.
</p>
<p> 
Today but he did not play. Uncle Henry sat at the door and anxiously looked at the sky frequently. Dorothy stood at the door with Toto in her arms and looked at the sky. Aunt Em washed the dishes.
</p>
<p> 
The distant north wind's low cry of grief and Uncle Henry and Dorothy saw the long grass bow with the small wave. The sharp sound of the air to the south and they turned their eyes and they saw the wave in the grass come together to the south.
</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Uncle Henry was standing.</p>
<p> 
"A tornado is coming, Em," he shouted to his wife; I will approach and manage the cows and horses. He ran to the barn where the cows and horses were kept.
</p>
<p> 
Aunt Em dropped the work and arrived at the door. She glanced at the danger nearby.
</p>
<p> "Quickly, Dorothy! She screamed; Run to the basement!" </p>
<p> 
Toto leaped forward and opened his arm and then hid under the beds. The girl started to approach him. Aunt Em was greatly frightened and opened the windows of the house and then clambered down the small dark holes. Dorothy approached Toto with effort and then started to follow her aunt. Half of the rooms shrieked loudly with the wind and then vibrated greatly and lost their footing and then unexpectedly took a seat on the floor.
</p>
<p> 
An unusual situation occurred.
</p>
<p>  
The house spun once or once or once and slowly rose into the air. Dorothy felt because it rose into the balloon.
</p>
<p> 
The northern winds and the southern winds came together at the house and stood and moved easily in the center of the cyclone. The center of the cyclone is usually the atmosphere but the high pressure of the wind raised the house to a high place and because of that it was very high in the cyclone. And from there it occupied and moved a mile and a mile from the birds you carried.
</p>
<p> 
It was very dark and the wind howled terribly but Dorothy accidentally met them riding easily. Event after event, the house severely tilted and they felt they rocked gently like a baby cradle.
</p>
<p> 
Toto did not enjoy it. He ran to the room loudly but Dorothy sat on the floor and waited to meet what will happen.
</p>
<p> 
Toto got a nearby open opening and fell. A young girl hoped she failed. But soon she saw her ear get an opening because strong air pressure made her fall so she did not fall. She crawled to the opening and Toto found with the ear and she pulled the room soon; closed the opening so no accidents happened.
</p>
<p> 
An hour and an hour passed slowly and Dorothy felt fears. But she felt lonely and the wind cried loudly as she fainted deaf. As she doubted that she would cause the house to fall as well. But an hour and an hour passed and nothing bad happened and she ended her worry and settled waiting calmly and would meet and cause the future. As she slowly moved back and forth on the floor of the bed and lay down as Toto followed and lay down as well.
</p>
<p> 
The house closed but the wind cried, Dorothy will soon close Dorothy's eyes and fall asleep.

                <div class="content"><p>The Cyclone.</p>
<p>Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cooking stove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole, dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap-door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.</p>
<p>When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.</p>
<p>When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled, now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.</p>
<p>Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.</p>
<p>It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long, silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.</p>
<p>To-day, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the door-step and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.</p>
<p>From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also.</p>
<p>Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.</p>
<p>"There's a cyclone coming, Em," he called to his wife; "I'll go look after the stock." Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept.</p>
<p>Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of the danger close at hand.</p>
<p>"Quick, Dorothy!" she screamed; "run for the cellar!"</p>
<p>Toto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl started to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap-door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole. Dorothy caught Toto at last, and started to follow her aunt. When she was half way across the room there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.</p>
<p>A strange thing then happened.</p>
<p>The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.</p>
<p>The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the exact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather.</p>
<p>It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.</p>
<p>Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there, barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen.</p>
<p>Once Toto got too near the open trap-door, and fell in; and at first the little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again; afterward closing the trap-door so that no more accidents could happen.</p>
<p>Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright; but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her.</p>
<p>In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind, Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.</p></div>
